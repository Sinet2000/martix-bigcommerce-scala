## Introduction
This project extends an enterprise-level commerce platform—composed of various services in different languages (React, .NET, Go, NestJS, Python)—by adding **two Scala-based modules**.  

1. **Phase 1** (High Priority): Focuses on real-time data ingestion and analytics.  
2. **Phase 2** (Optional): Implements advanced inventory optimization and supply chain improvements.

By working through these phases, you’ll learn how to leverage **Scala**, **Akka**, **Play Framework**, and **Apache Spark** (or similar libraries) in a microservices ecosystem.

---

## System Overview
The existing platform includes:
- **UI** (React)
- **Admin** (.NET)
- **Order Service** (Go)
- **Catalog** (NestJS)
- **Recommendation Engine** (Python)

These services communicate via REST APIs, message queues (e.g., Kafka), and shared data stores. The **Scala modules** will:
1. **Ingest and analyze** data from these services (Phase 1).
2. **Provide advanced inventory & supply chain insights** (Phase 2).

---

## Phase 1 (High Priority): Real-Time Data Analytics

### Description
The **Real-Time Data Analytics Module** gathers data from the platform (orders, inventory updates, user activities) and processes it in **real time**. It then exposes aggregated insights and metrics via RESTful APIs (or GraphQL) to the admin panel, dashboards, or any other interested service.

### Technologies
- **Scala** (2.13+ or 3.x) – Core language.
- **Akka Streams** or **Kafka Streams** – Real-time data processing.
- **Play Framework** – Building RESTful endpoints for analytics and dashboards.
- **Apache Spark** (optional) – For large-scale batch processing or machine learning pipelines.
- **Kafka** (or another messaging system) – For ingesting streaming data from other modules.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – Containerizing the service for Linux deployment.

### Communication with Other Modules
1. **Order Service (Go):** Sends real-time order events via Kafka (or HTTP) to Scala Analytics.
2. **Catalog (NestJS):** Provides product and inventory details via REST APIs or data streams.
3. **Recommendation Engine (Python):** Can receive or share metrics (e.g., top products, user trends).
4. **Admin (.NET):** Consumes analytics data for dashboards and reporting.

### Things to Learn
- **Functional & Reactive Programming in Scala**
- **Data ingestion and streaming** with Akka Streams or Kafka Streams
- **API development** with Play Framework
- **Integration** of a Scala microservice in a polyglot architecture (Go, Python, .NET, Node.js)

## Phase 2 (Optional): Intelligent Inventory & Supply Chain Optimization

This **Phase 2** module leverages **Scala** and modern frameworks to forecast inventory needs, detect low-stock situations, and optimize the flow of products across multiple warehouses and sales channels. It is an **optional** extension that builds on top of the core commerce platform, adding data-driven insights and automation.
---

### Description

The **Inventory & Supply Chain Optimization Module** processes data from orders, warehouses, supplier APIs, and product catalogs to generate predictions and recommendations. These insights help:
- Automatically trigger low-stock alerts or reorder requests.
- Improve supplier relationships by maintaining optimal stock levels.
- Reduce shipping delays and overall supply chain costs.

---
### Technologies

- **Scala**: Core programming language (2.13+ or 3.x).
- **Play Framework**: Builds REST or GraphQL endpoints to expose inventory and supply chain functionalities.
- **Akka**: Handles real-time, event-driven updates (e.g., stock changes, incoming shipments).
- **Spark MLlib** (Optional): Facilitates advanced demand forecasting and predictive analytics.
- **Kafka** (Optional): Manages continuous data streams (e.g., from order service, warehouse updates).
- **Database** (SQL or NoSQL): Stores inventory states, replenishment data, and historical usage.

---

### Communication with Other Modules

1. **Catalog (NestJS)**  
   - Provides product and SKU metadata (e.g., names, categories).
   - Supplies real-time updates for new or modified products.

2. **Order Service (Go)**  
   - Sends events for each new or updated order.
   - Decrements inventory counts to reflect actual stock.

3. **Warehouse/3rd-Party Logistics**  
   - Receives reorder requests when thresholds are reached.
   - Sends shipment and delivery confirmations back to the module.

4. **Admin (.NET)**  
   - Presents dashboards with stock levels, alerts, and supply chain metrics.
   - Accepts user input for manual overrides, such as forced reorders or expedited shipments.

---

### Things to Learn

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use Akka or other event-driven paradigms to manage real-time changes in inventory.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Leverage Spark MLlib (or external ML models) for forecasting product demand based on sales trends and seasonality.
- **Database Schema Design**: Understand how to store fast-moving inventory states while preserving historical transaction data.
- **Microservices Integration**: See how Scala services coexist with existing modules in Go, .NET, Node.js, and Python.

---

### Getting Started

1. **Review Requirements**  
   - Define the data flow for inventory updates (e.g., via Kafka or REST calls).
   - Plan how reorder thresholds, supplier info, and other configurations will be managed.

2. **Set Up Dependencies**  
   - Confirm connectivity to the messaging system (Kafka) and databases (SQL or NoSQL).
   - Ensure that other services (Order Service, Catalog) expose the necessary data endpoints.

3. **Configure Environment**  
   - Establish environment variables for DB connections, message broker URIs, and service URLs.
   - Containerize the service (e.g., Docker) to run on a Linux host or cloud environment.

4. **Integration & Testing**  
   - Integrate with the existing platform by publishing and subscribing to relevant topics or API endpoints.
   - Implement automated tests (unit, integration) to validate inventory logic and forecasting accuracy.

5. **Deployment**  
   - Deploy to a Linux machine or VM with Docker.  
   - Orchestrate multiple services (including this one) using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

---

### Resources & Hosting (Linux Environment)

- **Linux Distro**: Ubuntu 20.04+ or CentOS 8+ are recommended for a stable deployment.
- **Docker**: Containerize this module for easier scaling and maintenance.
- **Monitoring**: Use Prometheus + Grafana (or similar) to track performance and inventory metrics in real time.
- **Security**: Consider network policies (firewalls, secure credentials) for communication between modules.
